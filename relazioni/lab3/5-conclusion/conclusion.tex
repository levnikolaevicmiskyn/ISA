\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the result of this development process is a very performant, small and versatile processor. It can work
with a clock frequency higher than $\SI{850}{MHz}$ while still minimizing stalls thanks to the branch prediction unit
and forwarding unit.

As discussed in \autoref{sec:adding-abs}, where the ABS instruction was introduced, the generality and elasticity of
its components allow for minimal yet effective changes to support additional operations, or slightly change the
behavior of the current ones.
