\section{Simulated ALU}
\label{appendix:simulated-alu}
The following is the header for the ALU simulation that contains the ALU class declaration.
\lstinputlisting[language=C++]{../../lab3/project/sim/ALU/inc/ALU.h}
To separate the specific instance of the class from the operation execution, all the supported operation are
implemented as static function, which are automatically called when the \texttt{executeStream} function is used.

This function takes an input stream and an output stream as parameters. Input data is acquired, checked and converted
from the input stream, then the requested function to execute is retrieved through the use of a static map, the
function is collected and its generated result is written to the output stream.

It is also possible to use the same class to work on a single input through the \texttt{executeStep} whenever the user
prefers to run a certain hardcoded pattern for testing.
