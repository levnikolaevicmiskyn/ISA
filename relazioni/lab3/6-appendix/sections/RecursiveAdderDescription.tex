\section{Recursive Adder Description}
\label{appendix:recursive-adder-description}
The code of this block is in the file \texttt{ALU/arithmetic/blockGPGenerator\_LadnerFischer.vhd}, which is
reported below:
\lstinputlisting[language=VHDL]{../../lab3/project/src/ALU/arithmetic/blockGPGenerator_LadnerFischer.vhd}

It is possible to see how the recursion was acheived through a conditional generate statement: in the general case,
considered at line 44, the component instantiates itself with half the bit-width.
After some number of recursive instantiations, the bit-width finally reaches 1, triggering the other generate statement
in line 39. This is the degenerate case where the Ladner-Fischer network is receiving a single bit and consists of a
single input-to-output line.
