\section{Adding ABS}
Given the highly parametrized implementation, supporting an additional instruction set in a second version of the same processor is straightforward. As far as the decoding is concerned, the addition of the absolute value instruction amounts to adding a dedicated case in the combinational process describing the instruction decoder along with a specific ALU operation. The new ALU operation is just appended to the enumerated type that was already defined in the previous version.
