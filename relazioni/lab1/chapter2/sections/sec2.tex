\section{Control Unit}
The datapath derived from figure \autoref{fig:iir-dfd} requires two control signals to clear all registers and to enable the latch. A single status signal \texttt{VOUT} must be provided, as requested. The resulting ASM chart describing the state machine is in figure \autoref{fig:asm}.
