\section{Synthesis}
The final design has been synthesized. The maximum frequency analysis is reported in \autoref{tab:maxtime}. In a second run, the clock period has been set to $4T_{min} = 4.8\,\textrm{ns}$, with the data reported in \autoref{tab:normaltime}.

\subsection{Post-synth simulation}
Synopsys can produce a Verilog description of the netlist generated by the compiler. This allows to verify the correctness of the outcome using ModelSim. Moreover, by running a second simulation after synthesis, reliable data regarding the switching activity associated to every internal node can be obtained and exported to enable an accurate power consumption estimation using the \texttt{report\_power} command provided by Synopsys. The results regarding power consumption are reported in \autoref{tab:power}, where the simulation has been performed with a continuous stream of data (\texttt{VIN} always equal to one). It might be interesting to compare this to the case where the filter is operated at half the data rate (\texttt{VIN} enabled every other clock cycle), as seen in \autoref{tab:power_2}.
