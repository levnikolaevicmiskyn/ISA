\section{Filter Parameters}
Given the project specifications, it is possible to draw the \textbf{Data Flow Diagram} as shown in \autoref{fig:iir-dfd}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

This DFD implements the Direct Form II of an IIR filter. In this specific case, it implements the following equations:
\begin{align}
	\begin{cases}
		w[n] &= x[n] - a_1 w[n-1] 		\\
		y[n] &= b_0 w[n] + b_1 w[n-1]
	\end{cases}
	\label{eqn:iir}
\end{align}
It is thus necessary to determine the values of the $a$ and $b$ parameters. Thanks to the provided Matlab script \texttt{myiir\_design.m}, the derived results are:
\todo{Replace with correct coefficients (<1)}
\begin{align}
    a &= [-21] \\
    b &= [53,\ 53]
\end{align}

Following the project specifications, the filter is going to be implemented in hardware and will use an 8 bit \textbf{fixed point} representation: this simplifies the structure of the filter, but limits its precision. Moreover, the internal structure of the filter will be developed to prevent overflows by choosing a wide-enough parallelism in order to maximize the effectiveness of the filter.
