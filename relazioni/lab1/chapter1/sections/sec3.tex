\section{Reference Model}
Following the project specifications, the filter is going to be implemented in hardware and will use an 8 bit \textbf{fixed point} representation: this simplifies the structure of the filter, but limits its precision.
To properly verify the functionality of the filter, it is necessary to have a reference model that also works with 8 bit fixed point numbers. In addition, this allows for an insightful comparison of the filter's behavior when it is working in floating point (in Matlab) versus fixed point.

Truly fixed point operations are modeled in a C program where coefficients and data are stored using the standard \texttt{int} data type. A scale factor equal to $2^{n_b-1}$ is implied throughout the execution.\\
The loss in precision arising from truncating the $n_b-1$ least significant bits at the output of every hardware multiplier is simulated in C using the right-shift operator \texttt{>>}.
