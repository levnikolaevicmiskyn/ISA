\paragraph{Global routing} This step ends without reporting any critical error, the final summary shows the overall routed length for each metal layer involved:\todo{Copy and paste log file}


\paragraph{Timing analysis} The worst slack is $8.56\,\textrm{ns}$, slighly larger than the one found in Synopsys ($8\,\textrm{ns}$). The same situation occurs with the look-ahead architecture.


\paragraph{Connectivity verification} The are 0 warning or violations for this step.


\paragraph{Gate count} Total area and cell/gate count is:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	   \hline
	   Gates & 1143 \\
	   Cells &     459 \\
	   Area &     912.4 um$^2$\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Power analysis} Results are reported in \autoref{tab:post_pr_power_report}. The total power is slightly larger than the one computed by Synopsys (\autoref{tab:power_report_standard}), this could be expected since Innovus takes into account resistive and capacitive parasitics that will only increase power dissipation.
