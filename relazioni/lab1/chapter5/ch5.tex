\chapter{Synthesis}
The minimum clock period is found to be $T_{min0}=2.74\,\textrm{ns}$ by doing several synthesis steps after the maximum frequency analysis in order to be able to meet the constraint. The timing reports derived after synthesizing with $T_{clk}=T_{min}$ and $T_{clk}=4T_{min}=11\,\textrm{ns}$ are reported in \autoref{tab:timing_rep_standard}.
The command \texttt{report\_area} returns the data shown in \autoref{tab:area_rep_standard}.

\subsection{Post-synth simulation}
A simulation of the synthesized netlist accurately provides the switching activity for every internal net. The resulting power report is in \autoref{tab:power_report_standard}. To observe how power consumption is influenced by the data rate, it could be interesting to perform a power analysis corresponding to \texttt{SAMPLING\_FACTOR=4}, that is when new data is available once every four clock cycles. The bottom line of the corresponding power report is in \autoref{tab:pdiss4}. The overall power is halved with respect to continuous operation.
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Total internal power          &   52.6260 uW  \\
Total switching power &      24.5493 uW \\
Total leakage power &    2.0762e+04 nW    \\
Total power &    97.9375 uW\\\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Place \& Route}
\paragraph{Global routing} This step ends without reporting any critical error, the final summary shows the overall routed length for each metal layer involved:


\paragraph{Timing analysis} The worst slack is ...


\paragraph{Connectivity verification} The are 0 warning or violations for this step.


\paragraph{Gate count} Total area and cell/gate count is:


\paragraph{Power analysis} Results are reported in \autoref{tab:post_pr_power_report}. The total power is slightly larger than the one computed by Synopsys (\autoref{tab:power_report_standard}), this could be expected since Innovus takes into account resistive and capacitive parasitics that will only increase power dissipation.
