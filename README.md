# ISA (Group 12)
This repository contains source files and reports related to projects developed within the "Integrated Systems Architecture" course taught at Politecnico di Torino.
Each laboratory session has a dedicated folder named *lab[1,2,...]*. Each folder contains:
- A subfolder named *project*, which is reserved for core files (source files, testbenches)
- A subfolder named *auxiliary_files* containing scripts used only in the design phase at system-level.

In order to make each step of the design flow easily repeatable, further readme files are available in the relevant subfolders with the purpose of guiding anyone interested in using the material.

The special folder **vertools** contains an high-level verification tool whose source files are available in a separate repository. This tool is being developed within this group and is routinely used to carry out the verification flow.
